Q. What is tensorflow? 
A. open source library for graph based numerical computation (created by Google Brain Team) 

Provides low and high level API 
- Addition, multiplication, differentiation 
- Machine learning models 

Q. What is tensor? 
A. generalization of vectors and matrices, collection of numbers having a specific shape 

Q. What is an activation function?
A. To provide non-linearity

Components of a typical hidden layer 
Linear : Matrix multiplication 
Nonlinear : Activation function 

Optimizers
1. SGD: single learning rate, simple and easy to interpret 
2. RMS Prop (root means squared propagation): applies diff learning rate to each feature, allows for momentum to build and decay
3. Adam (adaptive moment) optimizer: perform well with default parameter values 

Random Initializers 
-> often need to initialize thousands of variables 
tf.ones() may perform poorly 
Tedious and difficult to initialize variables individually 

Alternatively, draw initial values from distribution 
1. Normal 
2. Uniform 
3. Glorot Initializer 

Sequential API 
1. input layer
2. hidden layer 
3. output layer 
4. ordered in sequence
